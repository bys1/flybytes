The design of Flybtyes was informed by studying the JVM VM spec, the ASM library code and documentation and the Jitescript API:

* <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/jvms8.pdf>
* <https://asm.ow2.io/>
* <https://github.com/qmx/jitescript>

Flybytes' implementation depends on:

* [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/)
* [Rascal](http://www.rascal-mpl.org)
